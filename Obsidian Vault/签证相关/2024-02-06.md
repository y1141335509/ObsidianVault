# Conditional Offer

是一种只有在员工满足特定条件下公司才会发放给员工的offer

## 1. Conditional Offer需要有哪些内容？
- The position title and description (with specific duties and KPIs if possible)
- Total compensation for the position (salary, benefits, etc.)
- A specific list of employment conditions and what exactly it means to meet them
- The potential start date (should all conditions be met on time)
- The due date for completing requirements (within the candidate’s control — background checks may take longer)
- The date of revocation if the conditions are _not_ met or no action is taken
- The date or duration of any trial periods stipulated in the offer
- Any relevant company policies or information about company culture
- (Where permitted by law) A specific statement of at-will employment, meaning you as the employer have the right to revoke the offer or terminate the employee “at will” or for any reason.
To ensure proper documentation, it’s best to issue conditional employment offers in letter form. Address each letter to the specific candidate, and list the return address with the hiring manager’s name and your company’s main address. You may also want to have your HR and Legal teams review your letter template before fully implementing it in your hiring process.
